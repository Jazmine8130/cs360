Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app needed to be able to add, remove, and update inventory. It also needed to have a notification to send in sms when inventory was low. Lastly it needed to save user logins and create new ones. 


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Having differeing buttons and pages were critical to this design. Theres a log in screen that also doubles to create a log in and then i used the same colors throughout the app and the same fonts.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached the coding process by trying to do it all at once, but realized quickly that was not going to work out. Thus i ended up having to work on each page seperately and then i was finally able to figure out how i wanted things to look. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tersted the code by having my phone be the emulator. I was able to use it just like any other app and i was able to use it to see where things happened. I found some bugs as i was using the app like how it would close and not move forward. This was invaluble as it allowed me to look into why it was happening. 


Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I was innovating when i had to figure out how to get the sms notification to pop up. I decided that i would jave a returning user ignore the page and a new user would be asked. 


In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The log in and sign up screen i was most proud of. I think this is because it was the first page completeed and gave me a sense of accomplishment. It allowed me to realise that I can code it and can make it work.
